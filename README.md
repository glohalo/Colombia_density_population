## Introduction to Spikes Data Visualization Process

Data visualization is a powerful tool that transforms complex datasets into intuitive and insightful visual representations. However, the journey from raw data to a compelling 3D map involves overcoming several challenges. In this post, we'll walk you through our detailed process, highlighting the key steps and the solutions we've implemented to tackle these challenges.

Challenges and Solutions

1. **Data Transformation:**

Challenge: Converting raw data into a usable format.
Solution: We load the data and transform it into rows and columns, followed by converting indices to coordinates (x, y) to ensure accurate mapping.

2. **Optimizing Computational Cost:**

Challenge: Handling large datasets efficiently.
Solution: To simplify computations, we group the data by adjustable grid cell sizes. Each point is assigned to a specific grid cell, and we normalize the total population by dividing it by 100,000. This significantly reduces processing time without compromising accuracy.

3. **Visual Representation:**

Challenge: Creating an informative and visually appealing map.
Solution: We configure a colormap (Cmaps) with gradient colors for better visual differentiation. Additionally, we prepare an image that shows the number of bins in increasing order to enhance the visual context before creating the 3D graph.

4. **Detailed Map Creation:**

Challenge: Accurately representing population density on a 3D map.
Solution: The process involves setting up the map figure, creating a 3D bar plot, adjusting elevation and azimuth angles for optimal viewing, and defining the vertices of the mean triangle. We iterate over each division to create detailed bars, culminating in a comprehensive and informative plot.

Special Note:
To ensure accurate representation, we divided the total population by 100,000 and used a cell size of 0.01. This approach means the population of San Andr√©s Island is adjusted to the nearest coordinates, ensuring it fits seamlessly into our visualization framework.
